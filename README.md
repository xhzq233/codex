## Relay subagents fork

This branch is an unofficial fork of `0.147.0-alpha.6.5` with a focused local
CLI patch set for relay-routed subagents and the ChatGPT App Chrome runtime.

The patch set:

- exposes v2 collaboration tools under the portable `agents.*` namespace instead of the reserved encrypted `collaboration.*` namespace;
- sends `spawn_agent`, `send_message`, and `followup_task` payloads as ordinary plaintext JSON while retaining the `NEW_TASK` / `MESSAGE` wrappers;
- keeps the legacy `encrypt_inter_agent_messages` config field parseable, but does not use it to select the transport;
- drops the last bounded-fork compaction checkpoint and everything before it when `fork_turns=N` crosses a `Compacted` rollout item, preventing an opaque summary from crossing providers;
- starts the signed ChatGPT App browser child through a narrow macOS broker, so Chrome pages opened in the App can be read by the CLI.

Build and test this branch from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/xhzq233/codex.git
cd codex
git checkout patch/plaintext-on-0.147.0-alpha.6.5
cd codex-rs
cargo build --release -p codex-cli --bin codex
just test -p codex-core
```

On macOS, the resulting binary is `codex-rs/target/release/codex`. Keep it as a
separate executable while testing; do not overwrite an existing Homebrew or App
installation. The Chrome broker is macOS-only and requires the signed ChatGPT
App runtime layout under `/Applications/ChatGPT.app`.

Known limits: this is not an official OpenAI release; `fork_turns=all` keeps its
existing full-history semantics; and the browser integration depends on the
ChatGPT App runtime and its currently supported layout.

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Run the following on Mac or Linux to install Codex CLI:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

Run the following on Windows to install Codex CLI:

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The standalone installers download from `https://releases.openai.com/codex` by default and fall back to GitHub Releases if a metadata or asset download is unavailable. To force GitHub Releases, set `CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM` to `false` (`0` and `no` are also accepted):

```shell
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM=false sh
```

```powershell
$env:CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM='false'; irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex
```

Codex CLI can also be installed via the following package managers:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

<summary>You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest">latest GitHub Release</a> and download the appropriate binary for your platform.</summary>

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).
